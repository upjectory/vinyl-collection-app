# ðŸŽµ Vinyl Collection App: Getting Started Guide

## Create Your Personal Vinyl Collection Website

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- A Google Sheets account
- Optional: Spotify account (for album links)

### Step 1: Use the Vinyl Collection Template
1. Open the [Vinyl Collection - TEMPLATE Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAzo6vCafjT6XekXP-nmN_gapEfnvyCjyyk4ZPo1K3I/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Click `File` > `Make a copy`
3. Save the copy to your Google Drive
4. Rename your spreadsheet (e.g., "My Vinyl Collection")
5. Delete all existing demo rows in the "Albums" sheet
6. Add Your Collection:
   - Start by entering ONLY the Artist and Album Title columns
   - Use the built-in helper buttons to save time:
     * Click "Fill All Metadata" to automatically populate:
       - Genre
       - Year
       - Artwork URL
       - Spotify Link
       - Other optional fields
   - Review and manually adjust any auto-filled information as needed

> [!INFO]
> **Tip for Custom Genres**: 
> If you have specific genre information you want to keep:
> - Use "Fill Blank Cells" instead of "Fill All Metadata"
> - This preserves your existing genre entries
> - Helps maintain your unique categorization
